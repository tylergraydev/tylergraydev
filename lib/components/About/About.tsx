            Hi, I'm a Senior Software Developer at Emergent Software with a
            passion for building great software and constantly learning new
            technologies. I'm skilled in Angular, C#, React, and have strong
            expertise in Azure cloud development. I love tackling challenges,
            whether it's writing clean code, optimizing cloud solutions, or
            exploring new frameworks and tools. Outside of work, youâ€™ll often
            find me building Lego creations, diving into Marvel stories, or
            adventuring through World of Warcraft.
